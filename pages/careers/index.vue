          We prioritize quality and take our time to make sure we get it just
          right. Our team come from places like Riot, Facebook, Coinbase,
          SpaceX, Amazon, Tesla, and NASA. We're fully remote (27 people) across
          the US and Canada. We get everybody together a few times a year to eat
          good food, hang out, and play games. We like to have fun.

          established companies, but with none of the unnecessary”.

          with engaged, driven, super smart people everyday who are eager to
          help and share the common passion to make our platform better. We have
          a direct connection to our users so we get to see instant impact and
          ship features and fixes that actually seem to matter in an online
          space that continues to grow. We deal with minimal BS and bureaucracy
          which allows us to do our best work without stressing unimportant
          processes. Our team outings make us feel tight-knit while all working
          remote to the point where everyone I work with feels more like a
          personal friend than a coworker I'm forced to collaborate with”.

          meaningful, intentional, and most importantly fulfilling. There is a
          sense that things always fall in the right place as if it's meant to
          be. I believe miracles like that only happen when good people come
          together to build something awesome and put their heart and soul into
          it. Which is what working at Learnify feels like. We are here because we
          genuinely want to be here, not for any other superficial reason. I
          have huge respect for the leadership team for facilitating this
          environment. It was a bit of a culture shock coming into Learnify and
          seeing how effective the team is. There is very little noise. Only
          signal. And I absolutely love that about Learnify”.

          our customers need so everything we build is impactful and our efforts
          are well-spent”.

          product that users love, awesome co-workers, a management team that
          listens, and very fair compensation &amp; benefits. Love it here”.
